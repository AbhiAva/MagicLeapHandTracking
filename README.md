# MagicLeapHandTracking
A Magic Leap Unity project for demonstrating what can be done with ML hand tracking technology

### Scenes

1. **ClothDemo** - demonstrates how to use hand tracking positioning when tracking KeyPose.Fist to place a game object at the tracked position and then use left and right hands to interact with cloth components in the scene.

2. **SuperPowersDemo** - demonstrates how to use hand tracking and head tracking by providing you with a way to spawn game objects anytime an open hand key pose is detected, when detected a game object is instantiated and force is added towards the aimed target.
