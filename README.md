# MagicLeapHandTracking
A Magic Leap Unity project for demonstrating what can be done with ML hand tracking technology

### Scenes

1. **ClothDemo** - demonstrates how to use hand tracking positioning when tracking KeyPose.Fist to place a game object at the tracked position and then use left and right hands to interact with cloth components in the scene.
